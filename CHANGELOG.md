## [2026-01-29]

### Added

- `todoist uncomplete ID` — reopen completed tasks
- `todoist completed` — list completed tasks with `--since`, `--until`, `--project`
- `flatten-subtasks.py` — convert subtask hierarchies to flat tasks with descriptions
  - Dry-run by default, `--execute` to apply
  - Automatic backup before changes
  - `--restore` to recover from backup
  - `--delete-subtasks` for permanent removal (vs completing)
  - Safety checks: nested subtasks, description length limits
