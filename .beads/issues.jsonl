{"id":"tgt-eb8","title":"Split todoist-gtd for claude-skills migration","description":"Separate the generic Todoist CLI from the user-specific GTD semantic layer so the CLI can be shared via claude-skills while keeping personal context private.\n\n**Current state:** Single skill contains both:\n- Generic CLI (scripts/todoist.py) - API wrapper, auth, commands\n- User-specific skill (SKILL.md, references/) - GTD coaching, Sameer's structure, terminology\n\n**Target state:**\n- Generic package: `todoist-cli` skill with CLI + minimal docs (shareable)\n- User-specific: remains here or in ~/.claude/skills with personal GTD structure","design":"## Approach\n\nSplit into two packages:\n1. **todoist-cli** (generic, shareable)\n   - `scripts/todoist.py` - the CLI itself\n   - Minimal SKILL.md - CLI reference only\n   - No user-specific structure assumptions\n   \n2. **todoist-gtd** (user-specific, stays private)\n   - SKILL.md focused on GTD coaching + Sameer's structure\n   - References: COACHING.md, PATTERNS.md, TERMINOLOGY.md\n   - Imports/depends on todoist-cli for data access\n\n## Key decisions needed\n- Where does generic CLI live? (new repo? claude-skills?)\n- How do skills depend on each other? (symlink? copy?)\n- What's the minimum viable generic skill?\n\n## Workflow\n1. DRAW-DOWN: Create TodoWrite items from acceptance criteria\n2. Work through items, check direction at each completion\n3. Update notes at milestones","acceptance_criteria":"- [ ] Generic todoist-cli skill exists with CLI + minimal docs\n- [ ] Generic skill makes no assumptions about user's Todoist structure\n- [ ] todoist-gtd skill remains with GTD coaching + user-specific context\n- [ ] todoist-gtd can use todoist-cli for data access\n- [ ] Both skills work independently (no circular deps)\n- [ ] Documented how to set up the dependency","status":"open","priority":1,"issue_type":"epic","owner":"spm1001@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-01-15T14:51:27.166227Z","created_by":"spm1001","updated_at":"2026-01-15T14:51:27.166227Z"}
