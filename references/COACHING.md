# Outcome Quality Coaching

Standards and examples for coaching on outcome quality.

## Quality Criteria Checklist

When reviewing or crafting an outcome, check:

- [ ] **Past tense?** Written as if already achieved
- [ ] **Achievement, not activity?** Success state, not task description
- [ ] **Team Priority link?** Explicitly contributes to Tier 1
- [ ] **Growth opportunity?** Builds capability, not just delivers value
- [ ] **Measurable?** Can verify when complete
- [ ] **Finite?** Has clear end state (unlike Areas of Focus)
- [ ] **Appropriate scope?** Not too large (epic) or too small (task)

## Strong Outcome Examples (Real MIT)

| Outcome | Why It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| "Secured ITV commitment to progressive Barb data sharing" | Clear achievement, binary (secured or not) |
| "Generated first cross-broadcaster Adalyser lift report using consistent control methodology" | Specific, measurable, "first" gives it edge |
| "Delivered thought-provoking session at FTVA Global" | Past tense, includes qualitative aspiration |
| "Rehearsed and presented at least one client-facing debrief which gets good client feedback" | Built-in success criteria (good feedback) |
| "Hired new data scientist for MIT team" | Unambiguous end state |
| "Halved the time to setup and spindown Household:Lift" | Measurable improvement, clear target |

## Before → After Transformations

Common upgrades from activity language to outcome language:

| ❌ Activity-Focused | ✓ Outcome-Focused | Why Better |
|---------------------|-------------------|------------|
| "Write Marketing Week article" | "Marketing Week published MIT perspective, generating industry discussion" | Focus on impact, not deliverable |
| "Complete GeoX Technical Documentation" | "GeoX documentation enables any MIT team member to run the product without guidance" | States the PURPOSE |
| "Complete documentation for all MIT product repos" | "New team members can onboard to any MIT product within a day using self-serve docs" | Success as capability enabled |
| "Made sure all remaining scopes billed by year end" | "All Q4 revenue recognised on time with zero billing disputes" | Outcome not process |
| "Attend BARB conference" | "Established ITV voice in BARB methodology discussions" | Result of attending, not attendance |
| "Build TVA collection script" | "Completed TVA collection pilot at scale" | Achievement, not artifact |

**The transformation pattern:** Shift from WHAT YOU'RE DOING to WHAT'S DIFFERENT WHEN IT'S DONE.

## Anti-Patterns to Challenge

### Pattern 1: Project Disguised as Outcome

**User says:** "My outcome is to write the Q4 strategy document"

**Challenge:** That's a project (Tier 3). What does the document *achieve*? What changes when it exists?

**Better:** "Team has clear Q4 direction with aligned individual outcomes"

### Pattern 2: Activity Focus

**User says:** "Attend 3 industry conferences"

**Challenge:** Attendance is activity. What capability or influence results?

**Better:** "Built measurement industry relationships that inform product roadmap"

### Pattern 3: Missing Team Priority Link

**User says:** "Learn Python for data analysis"

**Challenge:** Which Team Priority does this serve? Is it growth for its own sake, or strategically aligned?

**Better:** "Automated routine data processing → Contributes to: Operational Excellence → Growth: Programming fundamentals"

### Pattern 4: Too Many Outcomes

**User has:** 11 outcomes

**Challenge:** Target is 3-5. Many of these are probably Tier 3 projects or activities. Which ones are truly strategic achievements vs tactical work?

### Pattern 5: Outcome Without Completion Criteria

**User says:** "Improve Panel+ performance"

**Challenge:** How will you know when it's improved enough? What's the success indicator?

**Better:** "Panel+ delivers insights within 24 hours of broadcast (down from 72)"

## Coaching Questions

### Initial Assessment

- "What would success look like if this went perfectly?"
- "How will you know when you're done?"
- "Which Team Priority does this contribute to?"
- "What will you be able to do after that you can't do now?" (growth lens)

### During Refinement

- "Is this something you're *doing* or something you're *achieving*?"
- "Could this be a project that serves a larger outcome?"
- "If you completed this, what would be different?"
- "Who besides you would notice if this succeeded?"

### Pattern Challenges

- "You have 11 outcomes. The target is 3-5. Which ones are actually Tier 3 projects?"
- "Three outcomes have no Team Priority link. Are these personal development, or missing connections?"
- "This reads like a task description. What's the strategic achievement it enables?"
- "You're describing activity (the doing). What's the outcome (the having-done)?"

## Output Format for Outcome Reviews

When coaching on outcomes, provide:

### 1. Current State Assessment
- Number of outcomes (vs 3-5 target)
- Tier confusion identified
- Missing links flagged
- Quality issues noted

### 2. Specific Coaching Questions
- Challenge each problematic outcome
- Offer reframe suggestions
- Ask for Team Priority connections

### 3. Improvement Path
- Which to demote to Tier 3
- Which to close as achieved/abandoned
- Which to rewrite for clarity
- What's missing that should be added

## Remember

**Tier 2 asks:** "What do I want to have achieved?"
**Tier 3 asks:** "What do I need to do?"

The goal isn't perfect wording. It's clarity about what success looks like and whether it's strategically aligned.
